# Accordion Component

This project is a solution for the [Accordion](https://roadmap.sh/projects/accordion) challenge on Roadmap.sh.

## Project Description

Create an accordion component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The accordion displays a list of questions or headings. When a user clicks on a question, its corresponding answer or content section expands while collapsing any previously opened section. This ensures that only one section is open at a time, keeping the UI clean and organized.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Custom Properties, Flexbox, Transitions)
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Handling)
- Font: [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the `Accordion` folder.
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
