# Restricted Textarea

A simple textarea component with a character limit restriction. As the user types, a character counter updates in real-time. If the limit is exceeded, the textarea border and counter turn red to indicate an error.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure.
- `styles.css`: CSS for styling the component (Dark Blue Theme).
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for character counting and validation.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type into the textarea.
3. Observe the counter updating.
4. Try typing more than the allowed limit to see the error state.
